1. Project Synopsis
The purpose of this project is to develop a   or another approach (TBD), using data from the National Airspace System (NAS), to predict  the arrival throughput of an airport in the near future.

2. Background of the Problem
The Digital Information Platform (DIP) Sub-Project of Air Traffic Management - eXploration (ATM-X) machine learning model is seeking to make available in the NAS a variety of live data feeds and services built on that data. The goal is to allow external partners to build advanced, data-driver services using this data, and to make these services available to flight operators, who will use these capabilities to save fuel and avoid delays. Different wind directions, weather conditions at or near the airport, inoperative runway, etc., affects the runway configurations to be used and impacts the overall arrival throughputs. Knowing the arrival runway and its congestion level ahead of time will enable a pilot to perform a better flight planning and improve the flight efficiency. This competition seeks to make better predictions of runway throughputs using machine learning or other techniques.

3. Project Description
Given a collection of NAS data on traffic, airport status, etc., plus weather data from a variety of sources, build a machine learning model which predicts the number of aircraft that will land at a given airport in the near future (~3-5 hours in the future.
